	  	<h2 class='sectionHead'>About</h2>
	  	<p>The Junkyard is a place for storing dumb crap you don't want to look at anymore. We'll take pretty much anything short of radioactive materials! (Our <a href='#'>Sister Company</a> handles all of those!)</p>
	  	<br>
	  	<p>The Junkyard also provides some wonderful opportunites to find some neat crap, so feel free to browse our vast stores of junk!
	  	</p>

  	<h2 class='sectionHead'>Contribute</h2>
  	<p>If you got some junk to throw on the pile we'll be happy to take it, as long as it meets our criteria below.</p>
  	<ul id='criteria'>
  		<li>Must be an eyesore</li>
  		<li>Must have at least one sharp edge</li>
  		<li>No less than 50% surface rust</li>
  		<li>Could potentially be another man's treasure</li>
  	</ul>

  	<p>If your dumb crap meets at least one of the criteria(its a Junkyard, we aren't very strict.) bring it on by!

  <div id='jumpIn' class='section'>
  	<h2 class='sectionHead'>Jump on In!</h2>
	  	<p>If you are interested in browsing our wares come on by any day of the week at pretty much any time! Prior to admission you'll need to fill out 3-5 liability waivers and watch a short video titled "Junk Monsters and you", but don't let that scare you! The Junk Monsters are slow and quite dull.</p>
